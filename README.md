## Todo

* Activate Matterjs physics and add one body
* Add a ground
* Associate graphics with each body
* Move around with arrow keys/WASD 
* Experiment with snow forming
	* Create distance joints when close enough, break when too much force?
	* Try the attractors plugin and have them all constantly try to attract to core?
	* Apply torque instead of force to move? 
	* Does snow constantly fall from the sky? 
* Enemies?
* Levels?
* A boss????
